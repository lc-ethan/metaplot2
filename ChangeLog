	* There are problems with the drawing functions for other
	packages. For rmeta, if the study for one group is over 12, the
	vertical line for the effect will not be long enough. For metafor,
	there is some problem with the x-axis. They are expected to be
	corrected after finish the meta2DF for all of the objects in
	metafor.

	* separate all the steps in metaDF2Matrix into functions,
	therefore it is more easier to check the problem within each part.

	* meta2DF have been reconstructed into one coding style and
	meta2DF.metabin can handle the grouped studies at the moment. The
	related documentations are also stored.
